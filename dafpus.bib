This implementation executesa Doppler-only, bi-static, continuous-waveradar application using an Ettus X310. We useGNURadio signal processing blocks to execute asimple respiratory and heart rate detection algorithmthat extracts these vital signs from a subjectwithin the radar’s field of view. In severalexperimental trials, we demonstrate that the proposedtechnique successfully extracts the respirationrate and estimates the heart rate to within± 5 BPM of a traditional heart rate monitor.},
